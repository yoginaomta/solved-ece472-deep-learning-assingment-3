<strong>          </strong><strong>Problem Statement    </strong>Consider the mnist dataset consisting of 50,000 training

images, and 10,000 test images. Each instance is a 28 28 pixel handwritten digit

<strong>     </strong><strong>  </strong>zero through nine. Train a (optionally convolutional) neural network for

<strong>         </strong>classification using the training set that achieves at least 95.5% accuracy on the test

set. Do not explicitly tune hyperparameters based on the test set performance,

<strong>        </strong>a validation set taken from the training set as discussed in class. Use dropout and

<strong>       </strong>an <em>L</em><sup>2 </sup>penalty for regularization. Note: if you write a sufficiently general program

the next assignment will be very easy.

<strong><sup>         </sup></strong>Do not use the built in mnist data class from tensorflow.

<strong>Extra challenge (optional)    </strong>In addition to the above, the student with the fewest

number of parameters for a network that gets at least 80% accuracy on the test set

will receive a prize. There will be an extra prize if any one can achieve 80% on the

test set with a single digit number of parameters. For this extra challenge you c

make your network have any crazy kind of topology youâ€™d like, it just needs to be

optimized by a gradient based algorithm.
